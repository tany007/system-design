# Cache - Low Level System Design

## Problem Statement
Design a low-level Cache system. The Cache system must support the following operations:  
 - Put: Allows a value to be stored against a key in the cache.
 - Get: Allows retrieval of a previously saved value using a key.
 - Eviction: Supports removal of some keys if the cache is full and a new key-value pair is added.

## Expectations

 - Code must be functionally correct.
 - Code must be modular and readable, with clean and professional-level quality.
 - Code must be extensible and scalable, accommodating new requirements with minimal changes.
 - Code must have a good OOP design.
